# Tableau-Sepsis-Project
Data visualization project exploring early physiological indicators of sepsis using a Kaggle dataset. Includes data cleaning, feature preparation, and interactive Tableau dashboards such as time series trends, correlation heatmaps, and cohort comparison views. Transforming clinical data into actionable insights for healthcare decision making.

# Sepsis Early Detection Analysis (Tableau + Kaggle Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a Kaggle sepsis dataset to identify early physiological indicators of sepsis and visualize clinical patterns using Tableau. The goal is to understand how patient vitals and lab values change leading up to sepsis onset and to present these insights through clear, interactive dashboards.

Sepsis is a time‑critical condition, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project focuses on uncovering trends that may support earlier recognition.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Sepsis Dataset  
- **Data Includes:**  
  - Patient vitals (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure)  
  - Lab values (lactate, WBC, platelets, etc.)  
  - Demographics  
  - Sepsis labels  
- **Challenges Addressed:**  
  - Missing values in labs  
  - Outliers in vitals  
  - Class imbalance between septic and non‑septic patients  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – primary tool for visualization  
- **Excel / CSV** – data cleaning and preprocessing

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards
The project includes multiple interactive dashboards:

### **1. Time‑Series Trends**
Visualizes how vitals such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature change over time leading up to sepsis onset.

### **2. Correlation Heatmap**
Shows relationships between lab values and sepsis outcomes.

### **3. Cohort Comparison Dashboard**
Compares septic vs. non‑septic patient groups across key metrics.

### **4. Risk Indicator Calculations**
Uses calculated fields to highlight trend‑based metrics such as:
- Rate of change in heart rate  
- Respiratory rate variability  
- Temperature fluctuations  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Rising **heart rate** and **respiratory rate** were strong early indicators of sepsis.
- Certain lab values, such as **lactate**, showed meaningful correlations with sepsis outcomes.
- Visual patterns helped distinguish septic vs. non‑septic cohorts more clearly than raw data alone.

---

## 🎯 Project Outcomes
- Built a complete Tableau story that allows users to drill down into patient groups.
- Translated complex clinical data into intuitive visual insights.
- Strengthened skills in data cleaning, feature preparation, and healthcare analytics visualization.
