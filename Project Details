This project explores early physiological indicators of sepsis using a Kaggle clinical dataset. 
I cleaned and prepared patient vitals and lab values, then built a series of interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize how these metrics change leading up to sepsis onset. 
The dashboards include time‑series trends, correlation heatmaps, and cohort comparison views that highlight key predictors such as rising heart rate and respiratory rate. 
The goal of the project is to transform complex clinical data into intuitive visual insights that support faster, more informed decision‑making in healthcare environments.
